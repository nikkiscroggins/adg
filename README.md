# ADG Project
### ADG Coding test for eCommerce landing page. 

####<a href="http://creativewwweb.com" target="_blank">You can see a live version I put up here</a>

#### Included you will find: 
* The project requirements
* Their provided PSD
* <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/f5SiDEL6JHt8cxDURpSdLD3K/ADG?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=515%2C99%2C0.1322&scaling=scale-down&redirected=1" target="_blank">My Figma Mobile Mockup - was not required, but I provided them with a mockup rather than going astray from their mockup for the project. Your own design was an option. </a>

### Please note the JSON displayed on screen when filling out the form was one of the ways they said to display, I know not to use this method. 

#### What I did:
* I used the least amound of libraries possible. I know how to use bootstrap, but I wanted to show I could do this without libraries. 
* It would have been ideal to get a mobile mockup and build into a desktop site, but since I had a desktop to build into mobile, my media queries reflect that.
